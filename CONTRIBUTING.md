## Issues

If something goes wrong or does not behave as expected, please raise an issue to report it. At minimum it should include steps to reproduce, and the more detailed the description, the better; if at all possible, please include a minimal code sample that reproduces the problem.

Please do _not_ close bugs on your own unless the problem turned out to be on your end. A `fixes` directive in a merge request, however, is completely fine.

New feature requests and ideas are also welcome!

## Merge Requests

Want to contribute code to osl-status? Awesome! I'm always happy to review merge requests. Here are some guidelines to make the process as smooth as possible:

- First, if it's a big new feature or something else which involves a lot of effort, please open an issue to discuss before you put too much time into it.
- Stay focused. If you're tinkering with multiple things, use branches to ensure that your merge request only includes the relevant commits.
- Use prettier for code formatting and es lint for linting, (your editor may do this for you; alternatively, `npm run lint`) to ensure that your formatting is consistent with the existing code style.

osl-status uses the [Conventional Commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
